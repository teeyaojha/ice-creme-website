# ice-creme-website
This is a cat themed ice creme website that showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The project revolves around creating a visually appealing and user-friendly website for an imaginary ice cream brand called "Meowtastic Ice Creams" Leveraging Bootstrap for responsive design, I meticulously designed a navigation bar, incorporated a stylish background pattern, and utilized Google Fonts for an eye-catching typography. Notably, I implemented a client-side email form for user engagement. Through this project, I demonstrated proficiency in front-end development, attention to detail, and a commitment to delivering a delightful online experience. The project not only serves as a testament to my technical skills but also highlights my creativity in combining aesthetics with functionality.
